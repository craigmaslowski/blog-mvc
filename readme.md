# BlogMVC

BlogMVC is similar in purpose to TodoMVC in that it's used to show differing implementations of the same front end application with using different front end frameworks.

Where this project differs is that the use case is slightly more complex, including multiple pages, authentication, access restriction, and a full backend API written using Express.
