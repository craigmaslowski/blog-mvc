# BlogMVC

BlogMVC is similar in purpose to TodoMVC in that its purpose is to show differing implementations of the same front end applications with different frameworks.

Where this project differs is that the use case is slightly more complex, including multiple pages, authentication, access restriction, and a full backend API written using Express.
